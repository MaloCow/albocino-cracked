So basically, you can't code anything due to your skills issues, so you decided to use an public source code and rename it as yours, the program is just getting you unbanned 1d, after that welcome to a +200d ban. Why ? because he's using an public executor that is blocking fivem to access to some datas, almost like netlimiter method. 
PS : Open it in IDA and check for strings.

AND YOU MIGHT NEED TO RENAME IT AS A .DLL, DIDNT CHECKED A LOT THE CODE BUT IT SEEM TO BE A .DLL
